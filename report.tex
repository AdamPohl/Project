\section{Introduction and exploratory data analysis for the variables.}
The heart disease data set is a study into heart disease diagnoses from four different locations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cleveland
\item Hungary
\item Long Beach
\item Switzerland\\
\end{enumerate}

In this report we will be looking at how the means of certain variables are affected by exercise protocols; multivariate regression to estimate the coefficients for regressing variables against each other; dimension reduction  see which of the variables affect the diagnosis of the heart disease and  discriminant analysis/classification tools to distinguish patients based on their disease.

Each data set has 75 variables (76 as an indicator variable is added to tell the location) and all are numerical. Each location has the following amount of observations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 282
\item 294
\item 200
\item 123
\end{enumerate}
Which gives a total of 899 observations overall.\\
Using the \textbf{\textit{summary()}} function on each loction firstly all were missing the variables \textbf{pncaden, restckm, exerckm, restef, restwm, exeref, exerwm, earlobe.}

For the exploratory data analysis I will be looking at the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{age
\item sex
\item cp
\item trestbps
\item chol
\item fbs
\item restecg
\item thalech
\item exang
\item oldpeak
\item slope
\item num}
\newpage
\end{itemize}

First we see the correlation matrix for these variables for the whole data set.
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Intcormatrix.txt}

We can see hear that there are no highly correlated variables, naturally one would think age would have an effect on some of the variables.Below shows a large scatterplot matrix for 6 variables that take on more than 2 values.

To show what the data looks like further below shows bivariate boxplots of \textbf{age} plotted against \textbf{chol}(cholestrol) and \textbf{thalech}(maximum heart rate achieved).

In the next chapter we can find out how the variables relate to each other in more detail.

\section{Analysis to answer each research question}

\subsection{Question 1}
For this question since Cleveland and Switzerland only used one exercise protocol each rather than looking at the four data sets separately, it was looked at as one data set.Also, it appeared that the protocol values for Hungary did not match the description in the brief therefore the values were changed to:\\
\centerline{150 = 7,}\\
\centerline{100 = 9,}\\
\centerline{50 = 11,}\\
\centerline{25 = 11,}\\
\centerline{175 = 7,}\\
\centerline{125 = 8,}\\
\centerline{75 = 10,}\\
\centerline{130 = 8,}\\
\centerline{200 = NA.}\\
Each variable was assigned the number that represented the value to the nearest 25.

Next I created a subset of the data set with just the required variables, the variables rldv5, rldv5e and met were removed as the first had no values for Cleveland and Switzerland and the latter two had most values missing for Switzerland. So the code for the subset was
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
allproto1 = subset(all.df, select=c(proto,chol,
thaldur, thaltime, thalach, thalrest, tpeakbps, tpeakbpd, trestbpd,
oldpeak, indictor))
\end{lstlisting}

While running a couple of preliminary tests a lot of errors were occurring, therefore checking through each exercise protocol, protocols 4,6 and 7 had very few observations and protocol 12 had dependent columns, thus they were removed from the test.

So that the tests would run the protocol classes will be renamed to:\\
\centerline{8 = 2,}\\
\centerline{9 = 3,}\\
\centerline{10 = 4,}\\
\centerline{11 = 5.}\\

\newpage
\subsubsection{Comparison of covariance matrices}
To compute the mean tests first need to compute a hypotheses test to test equality of covariance matrices.For each we are testing\\ 
\centerline{ $H_0 : \Sigma_A = \Sigma_{p_i}$ $vs$ $H_A $ $: not$  $H_0$}\\
The tests give the following output


\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{box1.txt}
\underline{\textit{Exercise protocol 1(Bruce)}}\\
p-value: $< \num{2.2e-16}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence covariance matrices 
are differen.\\

\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{box2.txt}
\underline{\textit{Exercise protocol 2(8)(bike 125 kpa min/min)}}\\
p-value: $< \num{0.0001247}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence covariance matrices 
are different.\\

\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{box3.txt}
\underline{\textit{Exercise protocol 3(9)(bike 100 kpa min/min)}}\\
p-value: $< \num{6.739e-05}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence covariance matrices 
are different.\\

\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{box4.txt}
\underline{\textit{Exercise protocol 4(10)(bike 75 kpa min/min)}}\\
p-value: $< \num{2.2e-16}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence covariance matrices 
are different.\\

\newpage  
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{box5.txt}
\underline{\textit{Exercise protocol 5(10)(bike 50
kpa min/min)}}\\
p-value: $< \num{2.2e-16}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence covariance matrices 
are different.\\

All tests we reject the null so for the equality of mean tests we can use the James test.

\subsubsection{Equality of mean tests}

Running the Multivariate James returns:
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q1-Maovjames.txt}
$H_0 : \mu_{p_1} = \mu_{p_2} = \mu_{p_3} = \mu_{p_4}  = \mu_{p_5}$ $vs$ $H_A :$ $not$ $H_0$\\
p-value: $< \num{0}$\\
Decision: Reject the null\\
Conclusion: There is statistical significant evidence that the mean for each exercise protocol is different.\\
\newpage

To take a closer look, I conducted some two sample James tests to see if the means for any of the exercise protocols were equal. 
From the results we see that again there is statistical significant evidence that no means are equal to each other but what is interesting to see firstly for the James test R =1 all tests had a zero p-value other than the protocols 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, (tests shown below). This is not surprising as these are the protocols performed on bikes (with the highest kpa's). 
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q1-james1.txt}
$H_0 : \mu_{p_2} = \mu_{p_3}$ $vs$ $H_A :$ $not$ $H_0$\\


\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q1-james2.txt}
$H_0 : \mu_{p_3} = \mu_{p_4}$ $vs$ $H_A :$ $not$ $H_0$\\

Finally, when conducting the R = 2 James test again all tests had p-value's that give evidence to reject the null but testing betweens protocols 1 and 5 gave an answer of zero.
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q1-james3.txt}
$H_0 : \mu_{p_1} = \mu_{p_5}$ $vs$ $H_A :$ $not$ $H_0$\\

\newpage
\subsection{Question 2}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
model2 = lm(cbind(chol, thaldur, thaltime, met, thalach, thalrest, tpeakbps,
		tpeakbpd, trestbpd, oldpeak, rldv5, rldv5e) ~ proto + restecg + dig
		+ prop + nitr + pro + diuretic, data=datall)
\end{lstlisting}

Using the above code I created the necessary multivariate regression model.
I was able to use this model to get the following table of coefficients:
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_1.txt}
However this is not very useful, so I used the \textbf{summary()} function to
enable me to achieve a more detailed view of my analysis. Below I have tried
my best to explain the detailed view for each response variable.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_1.txt}
From the table above we can see that the predictor that had the most
affect in the value of the \textbf{chol} response was \textbf{proto}. As
\textit{chol} refers to the amount of cholesterol in a person's system and
\textit{proto} refers to the type of exercise that they do, it is not a major
surprise that this is the most important as in theory the higher the intensity
of the your exercise program the lower your cholesterol will be. The second most
important variable is \textbf{pro}; this is an indicator variable that tells us
if someone uses \textit{calcium channel blocker used during exercise} (it is
used in cholesteryl ester hydrolysis which helps reduce cholesterol) during
their exercise routine.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_2.txt}
The predictor variable in this instance is \textbf{thaldur} which represents the
length of time a person spends on an exercise test, it is therefore no surprise
that \textbf{proto} is the most important predictor as the harder the exercise
test the less time you will be able to do it for. The second most significant
predictor \textbf{dig} refers to whether or not the person is taking a drug
called \textit{digitails} during exercise. Studies have shown that the use of
this drug during exercise increases blood flow which could allow someone to
exercise for longer \textit{(experts are not sure if it is a performance
enhancing drug as trial results vary)}.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_3.txt}
\textbf{thaltime} refers to the time at which a person's ST depression was
measured. It is therefore no surprise that \textbf{proto} has the highest effect
as different exercises will take different amount of times to complete meaning
that if \textit{thaltime} is always measured at the end of the exercise test
people who do different tests will have different times but those who take the
same test should have very similar times.  \textbf{dig} is the next significant
variable which sort of makes sense as you most likely have to wait for the drug
to leave your system before your ST depression can be measured.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_4.txt}
The predictor \textbf{met} refers to the \textit{metabolic equivalent of resting
oxygen consumption while sitting} and therefore it is not much of a surprise
that the response \textbf{proto} is the most significant. It is also not that
surprising that it is as significant as before, as the trial that produced these
results most likely used people of varying athletic abilities for each test
in order to make the results more accurate.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_5.txt}
The predictor \textbf{thalach} refers to the maximum heart rate that a person
achieves during their exercise test and as such it is no surprise that the
response variable that is the most significant when calculating it is
\textbf{proto}. This is because the more intense the exercise test is the more
oxygen your body is going to need thus you will have a higher heart rate. Again
it is not surprising that \textit{proto} is only a 2* rather than a 3*
significance level as your maximum heart rate will depend on how athletic you
are, the more athletic the lower your max heart rate will be. \textbf{diuretic}
is the other significant response variable and it refers to whether or not the
subject uses diuretic used during exercise. Diuretic is considered to be a
performance enhancing drug so it is therefore no surprise that it only has a 1*
significance level due to the fact that the analysis up to now has shown that
there is a high probability that athletes are involved in this trial and would
be band by WADA if they were caught using it.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_6.txt}
The \textbf{thalrest} variable refers to the subjects resting heart rate and the
only variable that has any significant effect on the outcome of this result is
\textbf{nitr} which tells us whether or not the subject uses nitrates used
during their exercise. I am not quite sure what the use of nitrates has to do
with the resting heart rates but I do know that they are added to `unhealthy
foods` such as \textit{bacon, sandwich meats and salami} which could indicate
that they are not very athletic but a high resting heart does not mean that
someone is less athletic.

\newpage
In this trial the subjects the measuring of their peak blood pressure was split
into two different variables: \textbf{tpeakbps} and \textbf{tpeakbpd}, google
wasn't able to explain why this is the case.
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_7.txt}
For the variable that had the most significant affect on \textbf{tpeakbps} was
(as normal it seems in this trial) \textbf{proto}. This is most likely because
of the fact that exercise can lower your blood pressure and therefore the
subjects that are able to take the more intensive exercise tests were likely to
have a lower peak blood pressure.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_8.txt}
The response variable that was most significant when working out the predictor
\textbf{tpeakbpd} was \textbf{dig}.  This makes sense as studies have shown that
the use of the drug digitalis during exercise lowers a person's blood pressure.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_9.txt}
The predictor variable \textbf{trestbpd} refers to the subjects resting blood
pressure. As this must be taken before any exercise is started it makes sense
that none of the responses are significant in determining what this value shall
be due to them being manly related to the exercise test the subject takes.

\newpage
\lstinputlisting[frame=single]{Q2_output/Q2_2_10.txt}
The predictor variable \textbf{oldpeak} refers to \textit{ST depression induced
by exercise relative to rest} (which I understand from google to be a fancy way
of saying that the subject gets a small heart attack during exercise). It makes
sense then that the most significant variable in deciding what the value of
which if it is high can cause heart attacks.
\textit{oldpeak} is going to be is \textbf{pro} as helps to lower cholesterol

\newpage
The next two predictors, \textbf{rldv5} and \textbf{rldv5e}, refer to
\textit{height at rest} and \textit{height at peak exercise}. I don't know what
\textit{height} they are referring to (I am assuming it is not just how tall
they are as that would be dull to measure at rest and during peak exercise as it
would not change) and luckily none of the response variables are significant in
working out what the values of the variables will be.

\subsection{Question 3}

Due to that each dataset is missing different variables from the data, we have decided that in order to maximise the amount of variables we have, we are going to be using each dataset independent of the others. 

For each dataset we removed the dummy variables and variables that were missing at least a percentage of data. This percent was different for each data set and we were aiming for approximate at least double the number of observations to the number of variables. 

\subsubsection{Cleveland}

After removing dummy variables and variables with at least $90\%$ NA data, we are left with 45 variables and 201 observations.
